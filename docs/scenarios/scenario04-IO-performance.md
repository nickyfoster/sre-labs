# Scenario 4: I/O Performance Degradation

## Problem Setup
### Introduce High I/O Wait
Utilize tools like `dd` or `stress-ng` to create heavy read/write operations on the disk. For example, `dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/testfile bs=1G count=10 oflag=dsync` creates a large file with heavy write I/O.
Another option is `stress-ng --hdd 4`, which stresses the disk with four workers.

### Create a Large Number of Small Files
Use a script to generate a massive number of small files in a directory. This can be done with a simple loop in a shell script.
For instance, using `for i in {1..10000}; do touch /some/directory/file$i; done` will create thousands of files.

## Expected Impact
- High I/O can lead to system sluggishness, longer load times for applications, and overall degradation of system performance.
- A large number of small files in a directory can slow down file system operations like listing, opening, and modifying files.

## Troubleshooting Hints
**Analyze I/O Statistics**:
- Use `iostat` to monitor I/O statistics and identify high I/O activity.
- `vmstat` can also provide insights into I/O wait times and block I/O.

**Identify High I/O Processes**:
- Utilize `iotop` or `atop` to see real-time I/O usage and pinpoint processes causing high I/O.

**Examine File System Operations**:
- In case of large numbers of files in a directory, using `ls -l | wc -l` in the directory can help confirm the issue.
- Commands like `find` can be used to manage and potentially remove excess files.

**Mitigation and System Recovery**:
- Stopping or tuning the process causing high I/O can help.
- In the case of numerous small files, a cleanup script might be needed to remove them and restore normal operation.

## Additional Tips
- Stress the importance of monitoring tools and understanding their output.
- Discuss how I/O bottlenecks can affect not only the local system but also other systems and services, especially in networked and cloud environments.
- Encourage a methodical approach to identify whether the issue is with read or write operations, and whether it's impacting specific applications or the system as a whole.
- Highlight best practices in file system management and the impact of file system structure on performance.
